=====

This is an application that will allow the user to do the following

1. point it at 1 or more MARC files (either binary or MARCXML)
1. tell the application what type of MARC file it is (binary or MARCXML)
1. have the system convert all the MARC records into IIIF manifests with only the descriptive metadata defined.

This will require the following tool (which is out of scope of this product)

1. an application that will take the generated IIIF manifests and a location of digital files and add the matching files to each IIIF manifest thereby build the sequences for each manifest.
